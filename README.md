## Improvements
- Dapper or ADO.NET would be better in terms of performance than EF Core
- Microservice architecture would be better than Clean Architecture, if we're planning to add more entities
- Encrypting/Decrypting of sensitive data would be good if we plan to add passwords

## Assumptions
- I assumed that I can use .NET Aspire as an orchestrator, for easier self-deployment which will be possible across the platforms
- I assumed that 'Time interval when itâ€™s better to call (in case a call is needed)' is a string, but it could be also DateTime.

### Total Hours Spent: 2.5 Hours.
